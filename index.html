        <h1>File System cont'd</h1>
        <h2>CS 111 Lecture 12 (2/22/16)</h2>
        <h4>By: Andy Kuang, Patrick Deshpande, Rishub Kumar, and Stan Jiang</h4>

        <br>


    <a id="hybrid"></a>
    <h2>Hybrid Data Structure</h2><br>
    <p>
        Exists in main memory and on disk <br>
        &emsp; - Persistence (Disk) <br>
        &emsp; - Performance (RAM) 

        <br><br>

        Now let's look at how different file systems handle directories. The RT-11 just has a base directory while the FAT has a tree structure where directories are nested within eachother
    </p>
    
    <br>

    <a id="linux"></a>
    <h3>Linux Ext3 File System</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
    Directory Entry Structure <br>
        &emsp; - 32-bit inode number<br>
        &emsp; - 16-bit directory entry length (where the next inode starts)<br>
        &emsp; - 8-bit  name length<br>
        &emsp; - 8-bit  file type<br>
        &emsp; - 10-byte file name
    </p>
    <p>As we can see, there are varying length entries.</p>    
    <img src="img/Ext3_Dir_Entry.png">
    <br><br>

    <p>
        Why is Directory Entry Length so big (16-bit)?<br>
        When ext3 wants to delect a directory entry, it just increases the record of the previous entry to the end of the deleted entry.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <code>unlink("foo.bar") <br></code>
        &emsp; - lets you remove directory entries <br>
        &emsp; - 16-bit so it can overwrite the next entry, thereby deleting that file entry
    </p>

    <p>
        <code>link("baz", xxx) <br> </code>
        &emsp; - goes through the list and finds and entry with sufficiently large number to fit the new file
    </p>

    <p>
        The 0th inode entry is left empty so it doesn't need to be unlinked since there is no preceeding 
        inode entry that can overwrite it.
    </p>

    <p>
        Inode: in main memory and on disk, contains metadata for file:<br>
        &emsp; - an array<br>
        &emsp; - cached version of what's on disk<br>
        &emsp; - fixed size<br>
        &emsp; - contains number, no names<br>
        &emsp; - 0 means that the file doesn't exist, starts at 1
    </p>

    <p>
        Inode structure: <br>
        &emsp; - owner (32-bit)<br>
        &emsp; - timestamp (last modified time)<br>
        &emsp; - access time (mtime, sysclock)<br>
        &emsp; - inode change (ctime)<br>
        &emsp; - permissions <br>
        &emsp; - file type (directory/regular file/...) < both in inode and in cached directory entry
    </p>

    
    <img src="img/Inode_Entry.png">

    <br><br>

    <p>
        Inode refers to the info of the file and a Directory Entry refers to the info of the name of the file.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Why cache type and not other? <br>
        &emsp; - Type cannot change: inmutable<br>
        &emsp; - Other data can change
    </p>

    <p>
        Inode does't tell you the file name <br>
        &emsp; - File name built atop inode<br>
        &emsp; - Levels of abstraction in file system
    </p>

    <br><br>    

    <p><img src="img/Lvls_of_Abstraction.png"></p>

    <br><br>



    <a id="remove"></a>
    <h2>Removing File Securely</h2><br>
    <p>
        <code>unlink("foo.txt")</code> removes directory entry, or in other words it removes a link to a file (note <code>rm</code>is implemented with this sys call) <br>
        &emsp; -  The link count to foo.txt could still be nonzero, meaning we have not removed all references to foo.txt<br> <br>
        To get the link count for a file, we would do the following: <br>
        <div class="well"><code>
            $ touch secret<br>
            $ chmod 600 secret<br>
            $ ls -l secret <br></code>
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        There are a couple problems with using unlink to remove a file. First, file permissions are checked at open time. Second, storage for a file with a link count of zero is not reclaimed if a process has a file open. This means a program could hog a file, preventing it from ever being removed. Thus, we look for a better way to securely remove a file, implemented by the shred program.
    </p>
    <h3>Removing a file using shred</h3>


    <p> 
        <code>$ shred file</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the algorithm that shred uses to remove a file: <br>
        &emsp; - open file <br>
        &emsp; - stat sys call to get size of file <br>
        &emsp; - overwrites file with random data (3 times) <br>
        &emsp; - closes file <br>
        &emsp; - unlinks <br>

    </p>

    <p>
        However, even shred is vulnerable. Lets take a look at how the root can defeat shred
    </p>

    <h3>How root can defeat shred, and mechanical failures</h3>
    <p>
        In root we can read from any directory at any time <br><br>
        <code>/dev/rdisk/00</code> <br>
        &emsp; - block special device <br>
        &emsp; - can read from shredded file's original sector <br><br>
        <code>$ shred /dev/rdisk/00</code><br>
        &emsp; - erase all of disk <br>
        &emsp; - bad sectors, hardware substitures bad sectory with replacement sectors (linked)<br>
        &emsp; - bad sectors may still contain sensitive information that cannot be overwritten<br><br>

        Problems can also arise on the hardware side. The problem is that disk drives are not completely reliable. A mechanical error can result in the disk arm missing the target, of course meaning that some of the original data is still there. Furthermore, it is possible with specialized tools to detect the 'history' of a location on disk, meaning we can see the previous value that was stored on disk. These problems greatly complicate what might seem like the simple task of securely removing a file.

    </p>

    <h3>Note on file locks in linux</h3>
    <p>
        File locks in linux are voluntary. This is to prevent programs from holding locks, which would prevent other programs from accessing files. 
    </p>

    <a id="interpret"></a>
    <h2>How To Interpret File Names</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        The name of a file is related to a number that refers to the place from the root of the directories.
        An example of this is <br> namei : <code>a/b/d</code> -> 12963 (12963 is used to reference <code>a/b/d</code>)<br>
        <img src="img/cat_abd.gif"><br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The command <code>cat a/b/d</code> will start looking in the working directory to find the file.<br>
        If you want to search starting from the root, use a "/" at the beginning.<br>
        &emsp; - e.g. <code>cat /etc/password</code>
    </p>

    <p>
        Each process has a working directory that is stored as an inode number in the process table entry.<br>
        &emsp; - You can change the directory using <code>chdir("x")</code><br>
        &emsp; - Similarly, you can change the root directory using <code>chroot("y")</code><br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3><code>chroot("subdir")</code> </h3><br>
        &emsp; - This is called a chrooted jail. The idea is that the process is not isolated from the rest of the system, which should only be 
        used for processes that don't run as root. As far as the process knows, the only files on this file system are those that can be found 
        in "subdir". As a consequence, commands such as <code>execl("/bin/emacs", ...)</code> would not work because emacs would not be able to access root, only subdirectories.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3>Directory Rules</h3> <br>
        &emsp; - <code>abc/.</code> ≡ <code>abc</code> <br>
        &emsp; - <code>/a/b/..</code> ≡ <code>/a</code>    *Note that this is not always true<br>
        &emsp; - <code>/..</code> ≡ <code>/</code> <br>
    </p>

    <br>
    
<a id="jailbreak"></a>
    <h2>Get Out of chroot'ed Jail</h2><br>
    <div class="well">
        <code>ln /usr/bin/emacs subdir/bin/emacs<br>
        ln /dev/tty subdir/dev/tty<br>
        ln /dev/dsk/00 subdir/dev/dsk/00<br>
        </code>
    </div>

    After creating the links, we are able to use the following code to break out of the jail:<br>
    <div class="well">
        <code>open /dev/dsk/00   <- for RW<br>
        ln {some other file to accessible location}<br>
        </code>
    </div>
